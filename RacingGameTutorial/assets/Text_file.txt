Not long ago on a road not too far away...

	Episode 1
    A DESPERATE CHANCE

It is a period of turmoil.
Grandma's cookies are
baking and you are across 
town. 

During Dad's nap, you 
managed to slip his keys 
to the new convertible.

A new hope to savor a
bite into a warm, fresh
out of the oven cookie
and restore freedom to
the galaxy...



Ah yes, percisely. I
realized you wouldn't 
make it driving 
against traffic, so I
found us a shortcut.
Although, I may have 
made some unpleasant
friends along the way.

Use the Space Bar to
fire my blaster incase
we run into any trouble.

We can also use the 
stale cookies you 
found as fuel. Here's
another 500 that I've 
found.


Making it to Grandma's
before the cookies
come out of the oven 
is our #1 priority!
